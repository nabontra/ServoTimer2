// Updated for Arduino 1.x by Nick Bontrager 2013

/* 
  This library uses Timer2 to drive up to 8 servos using interrupts so no refresh activity is required from within the sketch. 
  The usage and method naming is similar to the Arduino software servo library http://www.arduino.cc/playground/ComponentLib/Servo
  except that pulse widths can be in microseconds or degrees.
  write() treats parameters of 180 or less as degrees, otherwise values are milliseconds.
 
  
  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
  The servo is pulsed in the background to the value most recently written using the write() method

  Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins 3 and 11 is disabled when the first servo is attached

  The methods are:

   ServoTimer2 - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.



   attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.

   attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds

    default min is 544, max is 2400  

 

   write()     - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds.



   read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. 



   attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 



   detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin. 
  


The library takes about 824 bytes of program memory and 32+(1*servos) bytes of SRAM. 

The pulse width timing is accurate to within 1%
